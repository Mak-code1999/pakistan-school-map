# ========================================
# MAKTAB - GITHUB UPLOAD CHECKLIST
# ========================================
# Follow this checklist step-by-step
# Check off each item as you complete it

## PHASE 1: GIT INSTALLATION ✅
- [ ] Downloaded Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- [ ] Installed Git with "Git from command line" option
- [ ] Closed old PowerShell and opened NEW PowerShell
- [ ] Verified Git works: `git --version`

## PHASE 2: GIT CONFIGURATION (I'll help you with this)
- [ ] Set your name: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- [ ] Set your email: `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`
- [ ] Verify config: `git config --list`

## PHASE 3: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY (I'll guide you)
- [ ] Go to https://github.com/new
- [ ] Repository name: `maktab-school-map`
- [ ] Description: "Pakistan School Mapping Platform - Full-Stack GIS Application"
- [ ] Set to Public (so employers can see it!)
- [ ] DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
- [ ] Click "Create repository"

## PHASE 4: INITIALIZE LOCAL REPOSITORY (I'll run these commands)
- [ ] `git init` - Initialize Git in your project
- [ ] `git add .` - Stage all files
- [ ] `git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Maktab GIS application"`
- [ ] `git branch -M main` - Rename branch to 'main'
- [ ] `git remote add origin <your-repo-url>` - Link to GitHub
- [ ] `git push -u origin main` - Upload to GitHub

## PHASE 5: VERIFY UPLOAD ✅
- [ ] Go to your GitHub repository URL
- [ ] Verify all files are uploaded
- [ ] Check that .env files are NOT visible (they should be ignored)
- [ ] Verify README.md displays correctly

## PHASE 6: FINAL TOUCHES (Optional but Professional)
- [ ] Add repository topics: `gis`, `django`, `react`, `postgis`, `leaflet`, `pakistan`
- [ ] Add a repository description
- [ ] Pin this repository to your GitHub profile
- [ ] Add a LICENSE file (MIT recommended)
